# PHP Laboratory Exercise 03: Arrays and Loops

This repository contains a series of PHP challenges focused on mastering control structures and data manipulation. The exercises cover nested loops, array iteration methods, and processing multidimensional associative arrays.

## 📂 Project Structure

The laboratory is divided into three main challenges:

### 1. Multiplication Table (`Lab03_C1.php`)
Generates a complete multiplication table from $1 \times 1$ to $10 \times 10$ using efficient loop nesting.
* **Logic**: Uses a **nested `for` loop** where the outer loop represents the multiplier and the inner loop represents the multiplicand.
* **Output**: A clean, line-by-line list of mathematical products.

### 2. Array Summation Methods (`Lab03_C2.php`)
Demonstrates two different ways to calculate the sum of values within an array.
* **Foreach Loop**: Directly iterates through the `$numbers` array to sum values.
* **For Loop**: Uses a traditional counter and the `count()` function to iterate through the `$numbers2` array by index.

### 3. Student Grade Calculator (`Lab03_C3.php`)
Handles complex data structures to perform statistical calculations.
* **Data Structure**: A multidimensional associative array storing student names and nested arrays of grades.
* **Process**: Iterates through the collection, uses `array_sum()` for totals, and calculates the average grade for each student.
